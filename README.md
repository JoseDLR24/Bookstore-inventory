# Bookstore-inventory

### Live Site at: https://the-bookkeeper.onrender.com/
This is my web application, a book inventory system using CRUD with technologies such as MongoDB, NodeJs, and Express. Using personal styles through CSS and third-party styles using Bootstrap.  Some functionalities are missing but CRUD is completely functional.
